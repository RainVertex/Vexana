// Streaming parser that splits a model's token stream into "reasoning" and
// "content" channels by detecting `<think>...</think>` markers, which is the
// convention used by Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, and a few other open-weight models
// that expose chain-of-thought.
//
// Designed to be:
// - Streaming: chunks may split a marker across boundaries. the splitter
// buffers up to MAX_LOOKAHEAD chars so we never miss a tag.
// - Multi-block: a single turn may contain several `<think>` blocks. durations
// accumulate across all of them.
// - Pass-through safe: if no `<think>` tag ever appears, every chunk reports
// all input as content and no reasoning timing is recorded.
//
// The splitter is stateful, instantiate one per assistant turn, push chunks
// in order, then read `reasoning` / `content` / `totalReasoningMs` once the
// upstream stream finishes.
